--- abstract

A vCon is the container for data and information relating to a real-time, human conversation.
It is analogous to a {{vCard}} which enables the definition, interchange and storage of an individual's various points of contact.
The data contained in a vCon may be derived from any multimedia session, traditional phone call, video conference, SMS or MMS message exchange, webchat or email thread.
The data in the container relating to the conversation may include Call Detail Records (CDR), call meta data, participant identity information (e.g. STIR PASSporT), the actual conversational data exchanged (e.g. audio, video, text), realtime or post conversational analysis and attachments of files exchanged during the conversation.
A standardized conversation container enables many applications, establishes a common method of storage and interchange, and supports identity, privacy and security efforts (see {{vCon-white-paper}})

# Introduction

The generation of conversational data, contained in transcripts and multi-media files, is common in business, especially in customer facing organizations.
However, the storage, analysis and sharing of the data they contain is not currently a standard, hampering efforts for both system interoperation and responsible data handling.
Standardizing a container for conversation data (vCon) has numerous advantages, and enables the management of the conversation's content.

Often the system providing the communications service, the consumer and/or owner of the communications data and the communications analysis services are distinct systems and in many case separate business entities.
vCons provide a standard means of exchanging communications data between these systems and services.
The use of vCons can ease service integration by using a common container and format for enterprise communications, becoming the standardized input to communication analysis tools and machine learning and categorization.

* For organizations in dialog with customers or citizens, a vCon can be the container of where  conversations are stored and personal data protections are expressed, managed and governed.

* For conversations of record, the vCon can be a legal instrument, providing a testable expression of conversational fact, while enabling conversational trust and transparency.

* For machine learning efforts, vCons can track what information was used in the training of models. As the result of a customer right to know request, an accurate answer to how their data was processed can be derived and communicated, and as the result of customer correction or deletion request, the responsible organization can properly and ethically respond as required by governing law.


## What's in a vCon?

A vCon contains four major categories of data (parties , dialog , analysis and attachments), with descriptive identifiers and metadata (uuid, created_on, subject, references to related or earlier versions of the vCon), inside a JSON container that can be signed and encrypted.
The parties portion allows for an expanded set of data from a typical call detail record ([CDR]), with identifications of the participants or parties to the conversation.
The dialog portion contains a set of multimedia and media type elements, each representing the actual, physical conversation in original media form: text, audio, video and imagery.
The analysis portion contains data derived from the party and dialog portions, intended to carry items like transcripts, translations, summaries, text to speech, sentiment analysis and other semantic tagging.
Finally, the attachment portion contains any other documents, such as slide deck or sales lead information, expressions of consent or authenticity, which provides context and support for the conversation itself.
In addition to these four major categories, the vCon itself has metadata, such as unique identifiers, timestamps and references to other vCons through redaction or grouping.  The vCon may also contain integrity checking information such as the issuer of the vCon and tamper-proof features such as signatures.

## Data Responsibility: Privacy vs Utility

Since vCons are designed to carry conversational data between systems, they must provide the ability to balance the utility and sensitivity of the information they contain.
The transmission of information outside of a security boundary does not release the controller of the data from the responsibility of handing personal data.
vCons enable the best practices of personal data management through approaches such as data minimization, consent validation and integrity protection.

The parties section carries significant privacy implications and responsibilities; the very definition of the sensitive biometric data addressed by the GDPR.
Each party identified in a vCon represents an individual or entity whose personal information is being captured and potentially shared.
The vCon creator and any subsequent processors of the vCon have a responsibility to ensure that the collection, storage, and sharing of party information complies with applicable privacy laws and regulations (such as GDPR, CCPA, or other regional privacy frameworks).
This includes obtaining appropriate consent for data collection, implementing data minimization practices, and providing mechanisms for data subjects to exercise their rights regarding their personal information.

At the same time, the conversations defined by the vCon carry the most authentic and important data in many scenarios from healthcare to commerce; a powerful addition to any data set.
To enable adoption, the JSON format implemented by the vCon is the lingua franca of modern software; a frictionless integration to applications that require the human conversation.
It is expected that JavaScript handling of vCons in the front end and RESTful interfaces and back end platforms will be used for operations and manipulation of vCons.
Many media analysis services which will be used with vCons, such as transcription, already use JSON based interfaces.
For these reasons, JSON has been chosen for the initial format binding of vCons and the scope of this document.
Other bindings (e.g. [CBOR] or [CDDL]) may be consider for vCon in the future in other documents.

For most application architectures, JSON objects are created by applications, for applications.
However, most of the initial set of use cases for differ from this established pattern, and are expected to be in the interchange between front end and back end application and lower layers of the network stack, critical for enablement of analysis of conversations.
Thus, the contents of the vCon, if not the vCon itself, are generated by various and diverse network and communications elements like SIP user agents and SMTP servers, and then delivered across networks, and sometimes across security boundaries.
This diversity of conversational data creates difficulty in creating unified views of customer conversations, especially as they traverse conversational modes.
By providing a common mechanism to describe conversations, appropriate to the various network elements that create them, enables new scenarios and usage kinds.


## Use Cases and Requirements

### Contact Center Use Case

Contact centers typically handle customer interactions across multiple communication channels including voice telephony, web-based chat systems, electronic mail, Short Message Service (SMS), and video conferencing platforms.  Each interaction channel generates conversational data that is often stored in disparate systems using incompatible formats, creating operational challenges for organizations seeking to maintain comprehensive customer interaction records, perform cross-channel analytics, or implement consistent privacy management practices.

A vCon-based implementation addresses these challenges by establishing a standardized container format for each interaction while maintaining referential relationships between related conversations.  When a customer interaction spans multiple channels (e.g., initial web chat escalated to video conference with email follow-up), each communication system generates a vCon containing the conversation parties, dialog content, automated analysis results, and relevant attachments.  These vCons are linked through common case identifiers and sequential references, enabling downstream systems to reconstruct complete customer interaction timelines while preserving the integrity and context of each individual conversation component.

The implementation of vCons in contact center environments provides several operational benefits: unified customer journey tracking across all communication channels, enhanced analytics capabilities through standardized data formats, simplified regulatory compliance through consistent consent tracking and audit trails, efficient privacy rights management with granular data deletion and redaction capabilities, and improved quality assurance processes through comprehensive evaluation of multi-channel customer service interactions.  This standardization reduces operational complexity while ensuring compliance with applicable privacy regulations.

### Messaging Use Case

Healthcare organizations providing patient communication services across multiple messaging platforms including SMS, secure patient portals, electronic mail, and integrated telehealth systems face significant challenges in maintaining complete medical communication records while ensuring compliance with healthcare privacy regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  Patient conversations frequently span multiple communication channels over extended periods, resulting in fragmented medical records that impede clinical decision-making and complicate regulatory compliance efforts.

A vCon implementation in healthcare messaging environments employs privacy-preserving design principles including explicit consent management, data minimization capabilities, healthcare-grade encryption standards, and role-based access controls.  Each communication channel creates a vCon instance containing conversation participants, message content, automated analysis results, and relevant medical attachments, while maintaining integration pathways with Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems.  This architecture enables authorized healthcare providers to access complete patient communication histories for care coordination purposes while implementing granular privacy controls to protect sensitive health information in accordance with applicable regulations.

The deployment of vCons in healthcare messaging systems delivers measurable improvements including comprehensive patient communication records integrated with clinical data systems, enhanced privacy protection through granular control mechanisms for sensitive health information, improved care coordination between multiple healthcare providers, built-in regulatory compliance capabilities with automated audit trails and consent management, and enhanced clinical decision support through access to complete patient communication context.  This standardization enables healthcare organizations to improve patient care delivery while maintaining strict privacy protection and regulatory compliance requirements.

### ECRIT (Emergency Context Resolution with Internet Technologies) Use Case

Emergency services organizations require rapid access to comprehensive situational information during crisis response operations.  Traditional emergency communication systems create information silos where critical multimedia content, geographic location data, and inter-agency coordination communications are distributed across multiple systems and jurisdictional boundaries.  This fragmentation delays access to vital operational information, complicates multi-agency coordination efforts, and produces incomplete documentation for subsequent legal proceedings and incident investigations.

A vCon implementation for emergency services enables real-time creation and maintenance of linked conversation containers that capture initial emergency calls, multimedia updates from incident witnesses, location tracking data, multi-agency coordination communications, and post-incident investigation records.  Each vCon contains conversation participants (emergency callers, dispatchers, response personnel), dialog content (voice recordings, text messages, radio communications), automated analysis results (emergency classification, resource requirements, incident reconstruction), and relevant attachments (photographs, videos, location coordinates, official reports).  Critical operational features include real-time vCon creation and updates, priority processing mechanisms, cryptographic integrity protection, and secure multi-jurisdictional information sharing capabilities.

The implementation of vCons in emergency services environments provides operational improvements including complete situational awareness for emergency response personnel, reduced response times through expedited access to critical information, enhanced inter-agency coordination through standardized information sharing protocols, regulatory compliance through complete tamper-evident record keeping, and improved public safety outcomes through enhanced information management capabilities.  Integration with existing emergency services infrastructure including Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) systems, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and Next Generation 911 (NG911) platforms ensures that vCon implementation enhances rather than replaces current emergency response capabilities.

## Inline vs Externally Referenced Files

Due to the size and complexity of some portions of a vCon, both inline and externally referenced dialog, analysis, attachments and other vCon reference assets are supported.
For instance, vCons may reference a video conference media recording as an external URL with an accompanying content hash of the contents to detect tampering.
Alternatively, vCons may directly contain the media of the entire dialog internally, keeping the conversation in one place, and optionally encrypted.

# vCon JSON Object

## A Conversational Definition

vCons define conversations, and are created by systems during and after the conversation itself.
vCons provide ways to express and define the contents, participants and context of a particular conversation.
Unlike some measureable physical phenomena, like mass and volume, conversations are heterogeneous, relatively complex and contain relevant information outside of the physical phenomena, such as consent and provenance.
Some communication modes, like SMS texting, lack natural session boundaries and require explicit definition.
Thus, the definition of a conversation requires more than a simple scalar value, or a series of samples of a time-based waveform.
The definition of a conversation enables tools and systems to precisely identify, responsibly manage, efficiently process and accurately govern their use.

vCons also enables the definer of the conversation to express the scope of the conversations.
A vCon may contain any combination of content appropriate to the use case:

* A vCon may be a single audio recording, or a complete conversational journey from a text message, to a resulting conversation and a followup email.
* A vCon may represent a conversation between two people, a conversation between a person and a machine, or all of the conversations between customers and a contact center team.
* A vCon may be sent in response to a Right To Know request to a single customer, or to a governance body during an audit

None of the major parts of the vCon (parties, dialog, attachments and analysis) are required to be present, to maximize the conversations that can be expressed.
For instance, a recording without a parties definition is a valid expression of a conversation without defining the people involved, either because it is unknown, to be discovered through the analysis of the recording, or to be hidden for data minimization reasons.
vCons may have two or more parties involved, but since a fundamental role of the vCon is to define and protect the data it contains, at least one should be, in the words of the GDPR, a "natural person."
For instance, an interaction between a bot and a human is an appropriate scope for vCons, but a conversation between two bots would not.

## Parties
The parties section in a vCon serves as the container for all participant identity information involved in the conversation.
Structurally, it is an array of party objects, each of which can include various attributes such as telephone numbers, email addresses, names, and even structured contact information (like civic addresses and geographic coordinates).
The purpose of this section is to provide clear attribution of every interaction by documenting who participated in the conversation.
This not only supports accurate record-keeping but also enables accountability, context, and subsequent analysis of the conversation data.

For example, as defined by the vCon standard, each party object may contain fields such as telephone numbers, email addresses, participant names, and more detailed address and identification data.
This detailed structure ensures that each participant can be uniquely identified and that their roles (such as agent or customer) are clearly established within the conversation record.

The identification of parties serves multiple purposes beyond simple attribution.
It enables proper consent management by clearly identifying whose data is being processed, supports data subject rights requests by providing a clear mapping of individuals to their conversation data, and facilitates compliance with privacy regulations that require organizations to track and manage personal data throughout its lifecycle.
Additionally, the structured nature of party identification allows for consistent handling of privacy-related operations such as data deletion, anonymization, or redaction requests across different systems and jurisdictions.

## Dialog
The dialog section in a vCon captures the actual conversation content that occurred between parties. This is the core of what makes a vCon valuable - it contains the real communication that took place, whether that was spoken words, text messages, or other forms of interaction. The dialog section serves as the primary record of what was said, when it was said, and who was involved in each exchange. Dialogs contain the "ground truths" of the conversation.

Each dialog entry represents a distinct communication event within the broader conversation. This could be a single text message, a phone call, a video conference session, or any other form of communication. The dialog section maintains the chronological flow and context of the conversation, preserving not just what was communicated, but the timing and sequence of exchanges that give meaning to the interaction.

The identification and tracking of dialog content serves critical privacy and compliance functions. The structured format enables precise identification of which specific conversations contain personal information, allowing for targeted data subject rights fulfillment such as selective deletion of specific dialog segments rather than entire conversation records. The timestamp and party reference metadata provide essential context for privacy impact assessments and data retention decisions. Additionally, the content hash mechanism ensures data integrity while also enabling verification that external content has not been tampered with, which is crucial for maintaining the trustworthiness of conversation records in legal or compliance contexts.

The purpose of the dialog section is two-fold:

* **Content Representation**: It accurately captures the details of any conversation exchange—be it spoken words, text messages, or other communication types.
This ensures that the exact sequence and content are archived in a standardized format.
The content appropriate to dialogs are any of the times and places where personal data is communicated and recorded: audio, video, email, fax, rich emails as examples.

* **Interoperability and Analysis**: The dialog's structured format supports further analysis (such as transcription or sentiment analysis) and ensures that conversations can be reliably exchanged between systems. By storing metadata like timestamps and participant references, the dialog section also enables the reconstruction of events (such as when participants join or leave a conversation) and aids in analytic processing.

In summary, the dialog section is critical for recording, storing, and later analyzing the actual conversation data within a vCon object.

## Attachments

Attachments carry the context of the conversation; storing supplemental files and data that support the conversation record.
In the vCon, attachments are designed as an array of opaque objects.
They can be documents, images or any valid mediatype that can serve the proper analysis and comprehension of the conversation by providing context.
In them, they may contain expressions of consent, references to content authenticity, authorization receipts and business tracking objects.

In parallel with each opaque object is a set of metadata that enables semantic understanding of the contents without the exposure of the underlying data.
Attachment metadata contains information such as the type of data it contains, the party or dialog it refers to, and whether or not the data is contained in the attachment itself, or is referenced by external network identifier.

## Analysis

The analysis section of a vCon contains processed insights and derived information from the original conversation data,
serving as a bridge between the raw conversation data and business intelligence applications.
The analysis section increases the utility of the conversation record by transforming raw dialog data into meaningful information.
This can include automatically deriving summaries, measuring sentiment, extracting key topics, and identifying action items.
Such insights are pivotal in generating business intelligence, facilitating quality control, and supporting various applications where actionable information from conversations is crucial.

Analysis data represents a significant privacy consideration as it often contains processed personal information that may reveal insights about individuals beyond what is explicitly stated in the original conversation.
This includes inferred characteristics, behavioral patterns, emotional states, and other derived information that could be considered personal data under privacy regulations.
The vCon creator and processors must ensure that any analysis performed complies with applicable privacy laws and that data subjects are informed about what analysis is being conducted on their data.

The "Right to know" principle is particularly important in the analysis section, as individuals have the right to understand what information is being derived from their conversations and how it is being used.
This includes transparency about what types of analysis are being performed, what insights are being generated, and how those insights are being applied. Organizations processing vCons must provide clear information about the analytical processes being applied to conversation data, including the purposes of analysis, the types of insights being generated, and how those insights may be used to make decisions about individuals.

The analysis section enables organizations to extract value from conversations while maintaining accountability for how personal information is processed.
By clearly documenting what analysis has been performed and linking it back to specific dialog segments, the analysis section supports compliance with data subject rights requests, enables audit trails for analytical processes, and provides transparency about how conversation data is being transformed into business intelligence.

## Relationships between vCons

Relationships between vCons may also be defined, either through grouping, redaction or through appending past vCons.
Groups of vCons can be expressed, to indicate general interlationships.
Redactions are at the heart of data minimization, a primary technique of personal data protection.
vCons enable the sharing of limited data through redaction, while retaining the ability of systems to guarantee the accuracy of the redaction itself.


# Security Considerations

The JSON form of a vCon is contained in a JSON object in one of three forms:

* unsigned - for internal use or trusted environments where data integrity and authenticity verification are not required
* signed - for scenarios requiring data integrity verification and authenticity confirmation without encryption, enabling tamper detection while maintaining readability
* encrypted - for sensitive conversations requiring confidentiality protection, ensuring that only authorized parties with proper decryption keys can access the conversation content


# IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA considerations.
They will be addressed in other vCon documents.
